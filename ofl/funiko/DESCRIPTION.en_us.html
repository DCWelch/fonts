    Funiko is a handwritten typeface by Polah Type, expanded to the <i>GF Latin Core</i> glyphset and adapted for Google Fonts by David Welch.
	This casual typeface is characterized by subtle inconsistencies that add to the font's organic, natural feel while remaining relatively clean and presentable.
	Funiko brings a personal touch of creativity and spontaneity, adapting beautifully to traditional or all-caps settings, offering a unique yet cohesive feel in each.
